Instead, you use the hotspot feature on your phone to create an access point.

Although this is NOT the best choice, it is still a good choice!\n\nScore + 50!\n\nVPNs connect to your device through a secure private server, instead of directly connecting your device to the internet through a router / modem, which can leave your information vulnerable. While this in most cases is enough, sometimes even before you can access your VPN, the host of the network forces you into what is called a captive-portal which forces you to agree to the terms and services before being allowed to use the network. This time, even if only a couple of seconds, can leave you vulnerable. In most cases, this is likely not enough time for the attacker to access your infomration, but it is still possible.\n\nAfter thinking about it for a bit, you realize that it is probably better to connect to a VPN when connecting to the public network. Before you can turn on the VPN, the wifi forces you to agree to it's terms of service using a captive-portal. Because the router you connected to was already comprimised, the attacker was able to obtain some infromation about you.
