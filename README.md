# ConnectWorks
Connect Works was completed during my first year at IBM as part of the Developer JumpStart program. The goal of the project was to build a tool to help local P-TECH students learn computer networking and security fundamentals. This MVP went from conception to prototype using IBM Design Thinking techniques and Agile delivery methods.
